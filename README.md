## Description

This site was created with HTML, CSS and Javascript to meet the parameters of an independent project in the Epicodus curriculum. 
The site uses functions, looping, arrays and variables written in Javascript to take a user's number input and return an array of numbers and text depending on the values inputted.

### Specifications

| **The program takes a number input from the user and returns a range of numbers from 0 to the users inputted number** | User input: "5" | Output: "0,1,2,3,4,5" |

| **The program searches the number input for the number 3, if there is at least one number 3, the program returns "Won't you be my neighbor?"**| User Input: "23" | Output: "Won't you be my neighbor?" |

| **If the program does not find a number 3, it checks to see if the user number input contains a number 2, if there is at least one number 2 in the user number input, the program returns, "Boop!"**| Input: "12" | Output: "Boop!" |

| **If the program does not find a number 2 and has not found a number 3, it checks to see if the user number input contains a number 1. If there is at least one number 1 in the user number input the program returns,"Beep!"** | Input: "14" | Output: "Beep!" |

| **If the program does not find any numbers 3, 2, or 1; the program returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user number input value, including "Beep"!, "Boop!", and "Won't you be my neighbor?" for the numbers 1, 2 and 3.**| Input: "6" | Output: "0,"Beep!", "Boop!", "Won't you be my neighbor?, 4,5,6" |
